        "question 1:Why might you choose a deque from the collections module to implement a queue instead of using a regular Python list?\n",
        "\n",
        "answer:Choosing a deque (double-ended queue) from the collections module to implement a queue instead of using a regular Python list has several advantages:\n",
        "\n",
        "Efficiency:\n",
        "\n",
        "O(1) Time Complexity for Appends and Pops: deque allows for O(1) time complexity for appending and popping elements from both ends, making it very efficient for queue operations (enqueue and dequeue). In contrast, using a list can lead to O(n) time complexity for popping elements from the front of the list, as all remaining elements need to be shifted.\n",
        "Memory Management:\n",
        "\n",
        "Dynamic Resizing: deque is optimized for memory management and can grow and shrink as needed, providing better performance for large queues that require frequent additions and removals.\n",
        "Thread-Safety:\n",
        "\n",
        "Atomic Operations: deque provides thread-safe operations for append and pop methods, making it more suitable for multi-threaded applications where multiple threads may access the queue.\n",
        "Built-in Features:\n",
        "\n",
        "Rotate and Extend Methods: deque includes built-in methods such as rotate, which can be useful for specific queue operations.\n",
        "Semantic Clarity:\n",
        "\n",
        "Intention: Using a deque communicates the intent of the data structure more clearly, indicating that it is being used as a queue, whereas a list might be used for various other purposes.\n",
        "Overall, for implementing a queue, deque is generally more efficient and suited for the task compared to a regular list.\n",

        "question 2: Can you explain a real-world scenario where using a stack would be a more practical choice than a list for data storage and retrieval?\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "answer:A real-world scenario where using a stack is more practical than a list is in undo functionality in software applications (like text editors).\n",

        "Scenario: Undo Feature in a Text Editor\n",
        "Use Case: When a user makes changes to a document, each change can be pushed onto a stack.\n",
        "Operation: When the user wants to undo a change, the application pops the most recent change off the stack and reverts it.\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "Last In, First Out (LIFO): Stacks naturally support the last action taken being the first to be undone.\n",
        "Simplicity: Using a stack makes managing the undo history straightforward, as you only deal with the most recent change.\n",
